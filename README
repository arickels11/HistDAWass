# Exploratory Data Analysis of Air Pollutant Distributions using Wasserstein Metric

# This project uses datasets obtianed from the EPA website to transform annual data across the US detection sites into a symbolic dataset,
made up of annual distributions for each state for each ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. 

# Descriptive statistics are performed on the sets of histograms using the Wasserstein distance as the metric of measurement.

# Machine learning algorithms are applied using the metric, particularly cluster analysis,
to understand if the metric can successfully identify "simiilar" distributions
